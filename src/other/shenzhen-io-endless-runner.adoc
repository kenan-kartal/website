= Shenzhen I/O - Endless Runner

image::shenzhen-io-endless-runner.png[Circuitry]

I have built a tiny endless runner type of game circuit in Shenzhen I/O.
You basically try and avoid the incoming obstacles as much as you can, with each dodge increasing your point.
I have published a video of it which can be seen at the bottom of this page.
Let me share the code and explain how it works.

.Parts used
* 1 x Custom Screen [LuX Industry LX910C]
* 1 x 7-segment display [LuX Industry LX700]
* 1 x Push-Button Controller [N4PB-8000]
* 1 x Read-Only Memory [200P-14]
* 2 x Microcontroller [MC4000X]
* 3 x Microcontroller [MC6000]

The blocks in this game move at particular speed at each time step.
After they reach the bottom, a new block is generated.
There are two controllers managing it, one main and one helper.

Main controller spawns a block, moves it and removes it when it’s at the bottom.
For each spawn it gets the starting point from the read-only memory.
And it gets the speed of a block from the helper controller.
Lastly it sends the current block segment value to the collision chip.

mov acc x2
slp 1
jmp fall

Helper controller checks the score at each time step and if it is 10,
it switches the game into turbo mode and increases the block speed.

The chip responsible for player controller gets its input from the push-button controller.
Then it moves the player and clamps its value.
Then it sends the current player segment value to the collision chip.

The collision chip gets the active block and player value from the responsible chips,
and checks if there is a collision or if the player has avoided the block.
If the former, it breaks the circuit and ends the game.
Otherwise it notifies the score chip to add a point.

This last chip keeps track of the score and draws it on the 7-segment display.
It also sends the score value to the helper block falling chip.
When this chip receives data value of 1 from the collision chip
which means the player has dodged a block, the score’s incremented by one.
