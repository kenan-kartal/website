= Ray Tracer - Part 2 - Acceleration Structures
:toc:

In this part I will speed up rendering times by introducing an acceleration structure.


Currently we can render a 200×120 resolution image with 1.8 million triangles in about 75 minutes.
This is much less than ideal, it should be much faster.
The problem is that there are so many unnecessary calculations.
It is checking every primitive for each ray.

== Space Subdivision

One way to stop unnecessary tests is structuring the objects into a kind of hierarchy to determine possible intersections.
These structures basically check if there is a possible intersection with the contained primitive or not.
Checks begin at the top level and goes deeper if it succeeds.
There are two kinds of space subdivisions:

1. Spatial subdivision
	a. Grid
	b. Octree
	c. kd-tree
2. Object subdivision
	a. Bounding Volume Hierarchy

.Grid
Grid divides the space into equally sized voxels. A grid element may contain zero or more (possible partial) primitives.
It does not scale well with complex and non-uniformly distributed scenes.
Because if there are too many voxels then it’s too much overhead,
or if there too few then the ones that contain complex geometry will suffer greatly.

.Octree
Each node in an octree divides the space into eight nodes.
Then these nodes can divide their own subspace.
It can continue until each node contains some number of objects or it reaches a certain depth.
It’s a bit better than grid because a node can stop deepening early.

.KD-Tree
Kd-tree is a binary tree where the space is recursively divided into two by axis-aligned hyperplanes.
Unline octree, it can work with any number of dimensions.
But for 3D scenes only it is not a big advantage.
Planes can be chosen alternatively for each dimension and they can be non-uniform.
If median element is chosen for each division, it’ll be a balanced tree.
When a ray intersects with an object inside a node,
the intersection must be inside that subspace to be accepted.
Otherwise, there might be a closer intersection on the next node.

.Bounding Volume Hierarchy
Unlike the previous structures, bounding volume hierarchy (BVH) does not partition space into disjointed regions,
but objects into disjointed polygons.
So, the sub-spaces of a BVH may overlap but each subspace will contain primitives entirely, not partially.
Since BVHs may have overlapping sub-regions, in order to determine the closest hit in a node,
we have to check all child nodes.

=== Implementation

oth kd-tree and BVH has their advantages.
They are both adaptive to the scene.
Kd-tree partitions the space into disjointed volumes, so if the closest intersection is inside the volume of a node, the search is done.
But an object may be referenced by multiple nodes.
For a BVH each object is referenced exactly once per leaf node.
But the space of them can overlap.
BVH performs better in simple and moderately complex scenes.
Whereas, kd-tree is more performant for more complex scenes (Vinkler et. al., 2014).
Since the scenes we use in CENG 795 are not very complex and this is easier to implement, I have decided to use BVH.

In order to implement any of the structures mentioned above,
we need to actually implement a bounding box that will intersect with the rays.
A box consists of three pairs of planes.
For performance, the planes can be axis aligned only so the calculations will be faster.

I have rendered the Golden Dragon scene from before in a larger resolution (800x480),
which took only 7.8s.
It is over 500K% performance gain compared to the previous low resolution render.
The scene has 1.8M tris and recursion depth was 6.

== New Features

Now that we have a decently fast ray tracer, we can focus on adding some new features.

.Transformations
Transformations can be used to map model space into world space.
If you are familiar with a 3D software, you probably moved a mesh from one place to another.
That does not change the vertex data of the model, but its world space is different.
Transformations consist of translations, rotations and scalings.
Also they can form composites together.
In this project we have used transformation matrices which is an application of homogeneous coordinates.
One key note, normals after applying transformations may be skewed or not normalized.
To solve this, we can apply the inverse transpose of the transform and normalize the vector afterwards.
Also normals should not be affected by translations, so their homogeneous coordinate value should be 0 instead of 1.
Previously, the vertex data has been the same for both model space and world space.
Now that we have added transformations, we need to be careful about ray intersections.
Instead of modifying the primitives to get their world space positions,
we can transform ray itself to bring it to the model space.
We can achieve this by applying the inverse of the model transform.

.Instancing
In a scene we might want to reuse a model as many other programs do with instancing.
We could duplicate the mesh data for each new object we want to create, but it would consume too much memory.
Instead, these new instances can refer to a base mesh data and apply their own transformations.
We can set these instances to have their own materials too.

.Multi-threading
Finally we can make this program a little more faster with multi-threading.
I have divided the image into 16 parts and assigned each part to a rendering thread.
“Marching Dragons” took 108 seconds in my system in a single thread.
Its resolution is 1920×1080, and the base mesh has 870K triangles.
With multi-threading the total time is down to 17 seconds.
It is nice to render good looking images without waiting for hours!
